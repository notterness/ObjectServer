To build the fluent-storage-logger Docker image:
  
docker build -f Dockerfile -t fluent-storage-logger:1 .

This is the image that is used in the Kubernetes POD. The current version of fluent-bit that is used to push
the logs from Storage Server services to ElasticSearch. Multiple Storage Servers run within the same image to
simplify deployment in this version of the code. In reality, the would be a different version of deployment
for each instance of the Storage Server service.

There is likely a question about why there is a different fluent-bit instance per service. In this case it is
to simplify the storage-logger.conf file. There is a Index and Tag_Key that is added to the log statements when
they are pushed that is used to make searching and categorizing logs easier in Elasticsearch. This is a quick and
easy way to accomplish that.
