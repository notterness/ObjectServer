To build the fluent-object-logger Docker image:

docker build -f Dockerfile -t fluent-object-logger:1 .

This is the image that is used in the Kubernetes POD. The current version of fluent-bit that is used to push
the logs from Object Server service to ElasticSearch.

There is likely a question about why there is a different fluent-bit instance per service. In this case it is
to simplify the object-logger.conf file. There is a Index and Tag_Key that is added to the log statements when
they are pushed that is used to make searching and categorizing logs easier in Elasticsearch. This is a quick and
easy way to accomplish that.
